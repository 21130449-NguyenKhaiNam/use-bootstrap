# use-bootstrap
Some rules:
    + Use BEM
    + Use React.js + Babel + JSX
    + Use Bootstrap (Css + Js)
    + Use JQuery
    + Use fontawesome (free)
    + Use SQL (so because it's a small project so i will use sqlite)
    + In future i want to use Spring or JSP, ...

I use this file like file log beacause i don't like writing.

#1: I create module, files main and test commit.
Error: <<"remote: Permission to 21130449-NguyenKhaiNam/use-bootstrap.git denied to khainam23.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/21130449-NguyenKhaiNam/use-bootstrap.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403">>
Solution: << Remove old account in Control Pane -> Window Cretical and push again >>

#2: I link all file for index.html and test run
Error: I can't excute div or anything in file html at js
Solution: This is true, i can't anything beacause it's rule. So i can use js for create function and can run it on file html.
